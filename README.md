This is a project in which I will try to make a fully functional website for a microcredit organisation.

For this project I will use HTML, CSS, mySQL, PHP and JavaScript.

This project, as invisioned, will display basic information about the microcredit organisation, as well as, news created by the administrator of the website, and economy related news gathered from an API (which API remains to be seen).

There will be a user presented website, as well as, a website which will be used by the administrator of the website to create news.

The user presented website will have features such as:  
* navigation header with logo and buttons to different sections of the website
* slider with 5 most recent news about the company
* cards which will represent company's services
* short about us section
* contact form
* footer

The administrator website will have features such as:
* login form
* list with all of the created news, with a button to edit them, or delete them
* button to create new news articles
* create/edit news articles section, which will have a
    - text field for titles
    - a large text field for content of the news article
    - button to upload images, which will be displayed as thumbnail for the news article
    - button to upload images directly into the text field
